# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Product: Sebenza Logistics Suite

---

### **Feature Name:**
Sebenza Logistics Suite – Unified Logistics, Warehouse, and Accounting Management Platform

---

### **Problem Statement:**

Logistics companies, warehouse operators, and supply chain managers face significant challenges in managing projects, inventory, finances, and human resources across distributed operations. Existing solutions are often fragmented, lack real-time visibility, and require manual data entry, leading to inefficiencies, errors, and poor decision-making. There is a need for a unified, modern SaaS platform that streamlines logistics operations, automates financial processes, and provides actionable insights—all in one place.

- **As an accountant**, I want to generate invoices, record payments, and view financial reports so that I can manage company finances efficiently.
- **As an inventory controller**, I want to manage stock levels, transfer items between warehouses, and track asset locations so that I can prevent stockouts and losses.
- **As an HR manager**, I want to manage employee records, job postings, and payroll so that I can support business growth and compliance.
- **As a client manager**, I want to communicate with clients, share documents, and track service requests so that I can deliver better customer service.
